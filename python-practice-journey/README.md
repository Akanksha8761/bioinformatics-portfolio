## 🚀 Daily Progress

### Day 1: Data Types, Variables, and Type Conversion
**Date:** January 13, 2026

**Topics Covered:**
- Python data types (int, float, string, boolean, None)
- Print function and f-strings
- Type checking with `type()`
- Dynamic typing
- Type conversion/casting
- User input with `input()`

**Key Takeaways:**
- Python is dynamically typed - variables can change types
- F-strings are the modern way to format strings in Python
- `input()` always returns a string, requiring conversion for numbers
- Type conversion is explicit using `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `bool()`

**Exercises Completed:** 8 tasks covering personal details, product info, temperature conversion, string manipulation, user input, boolean flags, and type reassignment.

### Day 2: Strings and String Manipulation
**Date:** January 14, 2026

**Topics Covered:**
- String concatenation with `+` and f-strings
- String multiplication with `*`
- String indexing (positive and negative)
- String slicing with `[start:stop:step]`
- String length with `len()`
- Escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`, `\'`, `\"`)
- Raw strings with `r` prefix

**Key Takeaways:**
- String slicing is powerful: `text[::-1]` reverses a string
- Negative indexing counts from the end: `-1` is the last character
- F-strings handle type conversion automatically
- Escape sequences allow special characters in strings
- Raw strings treat backslashes literally (useful for file paths)
- Strings are immutable - cannot change individual characters

**Exercises Completed:** 7 tasks covering concatenation, decorative separators, character extraction, substring creation, user input with length, escape sequences, and palindrome checking.

### Day 3: Arithmetic Operators and Mathematical Operations
**Date:** January 15, 2026

**Topics Covered:**
- Basic operators: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Advanced operators: Floor Division, Modulus, Exponentiation
- Operator precedence (BODMAS/PEMDAS)
- Division types: `/` vs `//`
- Type conversion in arithmetic operations
- Practical calculator implementations

**Key Takeaways:**
- Division (`/`) always returns a float, even for whole numbers
- Floor division (`//`) returns an integer, rounding down
- Modulus (`%`) is perfect for even/odd checks and remainders
- Exponentiation (`**`) can calculate roots: `9 ** 0.5 = 3.0`
- Operator precedence follows BODMAS/PEMDAS rules
- Exponentiation associates right-to-left
- Use parentheses to make complex expressions clear

**Exercises Completed:** 8 tasks including operator practice, division comparisons, even/odd checker, power calculator, rectangle calculator, order of operations, simple interest calculator, and tip calculator.

**Practical Applications:** Built 5 functional calculators demonstrating real-world use of arithmetic operators.

### Day 4: Week 1 Revision & Bioinformatics Applications
**Date:** January 16, 2026

**Topics Covered:**
- Comprehensive revision of Days 1-3 concepts
- Integration of variables, strings, and arithmetic
- Introduction to bioinformatics applications
- DNA sequence analysis and GC content calculation
- Protein sequence composition analysis
- Molecular weight calculations

**Key Takeaways:**
- All Week 1 concepts work together in real applications
- String methods like `.count()` are powerful for biological data
- Python is used in real scientific research (genomics, proteomics)
- Breaking complex problems into simple steps is essential
- Type conversion and f-strings are fundamental to interactive programs
- Bioinformatics is accessible with basic Python skills

**Exercises Completed:** 8 comprehensive tasks including personal info display, geometry calculations, average calculator, welcome message, integrated mini-challenge, DNA sequence analysis, amino acid composition, and molecular weight calculation.

**Practical Applications:** Analyzed DNA sequences for GC content, examined protein compositions, and calculated molecular weights - real tasks used in research labs!

### Day 5: Conditional Statements (if/else)
**Date:** January 17, 2026

**Topics Covered:**
- Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
- Boolean values and logic
- if statements for conditional execution
- else statements for alternatives
- Python indentation and code blocks
- Type conversion with conditionals
- Decision-making in programs

**Key Takeaways:**
- Programs can now make decisions based on conditions
- Comparison operators return True or False (booleans)
- Indentation defines code blocks in Python (4 spaces)
- Use == for comparison, not = (which is assignment)
- Always convert input() before using in comparisons
- if/else creates two possible execution paths
- Modulus (%) with conditionals is perfect for even/odd checks

**Exercises Completed:** 7 programs including comparison operator practice, positive/negative checker, password validator, gene expression analyzer, adult/minor classifier, even/odd checker, and pass/fail grading system.

**Practical Applications:** Built password validator, gene expression analyzer, grading system - programs that respond intelligently to different inputs!
