# 🐍 Python Journey: From Basics to AI/ML

Welcome to my Python learning journey! This repository documents my progress from Python fundamentals to advanced AI/ML concepts.

## 📚 About This Repository

This is a personal learning log where I track my daily progress, code exercises, and projects as I advance from Python basics to artificial intelligence and machine learning.

**Started:** January 2025  
**Goal:** Master Python and become proficient in AI/ML

## 🚀 Daily Progress

### Day 1: Data Types, Variables, and Type Conversion
**Date:** January 13, 2026

**Topics Covered:**
- Python data types (int, float, string, boolean, None)
- Print function and f-strings
- Type checking with `type()`
- Dynamic typing
- Type conversion/casting
- User input with `input()`

**Key Takeaways:**
- Python is dynamically typed - variables can change types
- F-strings are the modern way to format strings in Python
- `input()` always returns a string, requiring conversion for numbers
- Type conversion is explicit using `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `bool()`

**Exercises Completed:** 8 tasks covering personal details, product info, temperature conversion, string manipulation, user input, boolean flags, and type reassignment.

### Day 2: Strings and String Manipulation
**Date:** January 14, 2026

**Topics Covered:**
- String concatenation with `+` and f-strings
- String multiplication with `*`
- String indexing (positive and negative)
- String slicing with `[start:stop:step]`
- String length with `len()`
- Escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`, `\'`, `\"`)
- Raw strings with `r` prefix

**Key Takeaways:**
- String slicing is powerful: `text[::-1]` reverses a string
- Negative indexing counts from the end: `-1` is the last character
- F-strings handle type conversion automatically
- Escape sequences allow special characters in strings
- Raw strings treat backslashes literally (useful for file paths)
- Strings are immutable - cannot change individual characters

**Exercises Completed:** 7 tasks covering concatenation, decorative separators, character extraction, substring creation, user input with length, escape sequences, and palindrome checking.
